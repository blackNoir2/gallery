My Project Showcase Website

Hi there! My name is Egbie, and I created this website to showcase my various projects. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build this website from scratch, including the use of flex boxes and JavaScript to open and close divs. I am excited to share it with you.

Hobbies

One of my main hobbies is learning and use the love of learning I have built several projects related to this hobby. You can find more information about my hobby and related projects on the hobby page.

Project Gallery

I have built a variety of projects over the past month, and I am excited to share them with you on the project gallery page. Each project has a description, images, and links to the source code and live demo. Feel free to explore the gallery and check out my work.

Movie Database

One of the projects that I am particularly proud of is the movie database that I built using JavaScript. The database stores details about various movies, including the title, year, director, and actors. You can search for movies by title or year and view the details on a separate page. I used JavaScript to create the search function and to hold the movie details.
