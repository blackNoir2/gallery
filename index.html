            this website. I built this website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript
            to showcase a range of projects that I've completed over the years.
          </p>
          <p>
            My hobbies cover a wide range of interests and skills, from artistic
            endeavors to technical pursuits. Each project reflects my
            creativity, problem-solving abilities, and attention to detail. I've
            used my technical skills to bring these projects to life and I'm
            proud of the results.

          <p>
            Welcome to my movie webpage! With the use of HTML, CSS, and
            Javascript, I have created a visually appealing and highly
            functional website that enables you to share and discover your
            favorite movies with ease. The website's main feature is its ability
            to add, delete, and view movies using object-oriented programming to
            store the data.
          </p>
          <p>
            Adding a new movie is simple and straightforward, with a
            user-friendly form that captures all the essential details such as
            the movie's title, genre, release date, and rating. Deleting a movie
            is just as easy, with a single click removing it from your
            collection. The website's organization system ensures that your
            movie collection remains tidy and well-organized.
          </p>
          <p>
            Viewing your collection is also simple and intuitive. With a sleek
            and elegant design and intuitive navigation, browsing through your
            favorite films has never been easier.

            Welcome to my webpage, where I showcase my expertise in web
            development using HTML, CSS, and JS. This webpage is a testament to
            the various skills I have learned, from flex boxes, CSS grids, and
            media queries to writing pseudocode, manipulating the DOM, and
            utilizing JS libraries and frameworks.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Another project I am particularly proud of is a movie database that
            allows users to search and filter movies by various criteria, such
            as genre, rating, and release date. It designed to be
            user-friendly and intuitive, utilizing a sleek and elegant design
            that highlights the search results and makes browsing movies a
            breeze.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout the development process, I utilized a range of techniques
            to ensure that this webpage is responsive and user-friendly. From
            utilizing flex boxes and CSS grids to implementing media queries and
            CSS animations, I have created a webpage that is both visually
            appealing and highly functional.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am passionate about web development and constantly strive to
            improve my skills and knowledge in this field. I believe that my
            proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JS, combined with my ability to create
            dynamic and responsive webpages, would make me a valuable addition
            to any team.

          <p>
            Thank you for visiting my webpage, and I hope that you find it
            informative and inspiring.

            <h1>Games - Rock, Paper Scissor</h1>

            <div class="body-img">
              <img src="game.png" alt="game picture" class="project-description" />
            </div>

            <p>
              In this project I built a rock-paper-scissor game using HTML, CSS,
              and Javascript. This game is a testament to the various skills I
              have learned in web development, from HTML and CSS styling to
              implementing game logic using Javascript and DOM manipulation.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the key challenges in building this game was designing a
              user-friendly interface that would allow players to easily select
              their choice of rock, paper, or scissors. To achieve this, I
              utilized CSS to create a sleek and modern design that highlighted
              the player's selected choice and displayed the results of each
              game round.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another challenge was implementing the game logic using
              Javascript. I utilized a range of techniques, from writing
              functions to generate random computer choices to using if/else
              statements to determine the winner of each game round. I also
              incorporated DOM manipulation to dynamically update the page with
              the results of each game and keep track of the score.
            </p>
            <p>
              Throughout the development process, I drew upon my knowledge of
              web development, including HTML, CSS, and Javascript, to create a
              dynamic and engaging game. I utilized responsive design
              techniques, such as media queries, to ensure that the game was
              accessible and user-friendly on a range of devices and screen
              sizes.
            </p>
            <p>
              This game is a testament to the many skills I have learned,
              including HTML, CSS, and Javascript, as well as the importance of
              designing user-friendly interfaces and implementing game logic
              using DOM manipulation.
